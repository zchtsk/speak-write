# Speak-Write

Speak-Write is a fast and simple voice-to-text desktop application leveraging OpenAI's Whisper model.

Most importantly, **this application is private**: All processing is done locally, nothing ever leaves your computer. Audio is automatically deleted after transacription is completed.

## Features

- Fast voice recognition
- Efficient transcription using OpenAI's Whisper model
- Transcribe your words using a simple keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+0)

## Usage
Download the [latest executable](https://github.com/zachtsk/speak-write/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

After the application is started, you can press "Shift+Ctrl+0" to start recording. Once you release the keys, the application will transcribe your words and paste them into the active window.
